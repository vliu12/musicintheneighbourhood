        <p class="aboutgallery">Music in the Neighbourhood has held numerous successful events in the past, with concerts in September 2022, December 2022, June 2023, as well as summer events. The concerts were held at the North Delta Center for the Arts, and lasted around two hours from start to finish. Each event featured approximately 20 performers, 10 volunteers, and 100 attendees. The volunteers were local youth from Seaquam and Burnsview Secondary who performed tasks such as set up, donation forms, and clean up. Over three concerts, we raised over $6000 dollars towards the “Balding for Dollars” charity. </p>
